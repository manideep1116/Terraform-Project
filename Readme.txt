Here in this project my intention was to create infrastructure with a VPC, subnets, Ec2 instances, load balancer, security groups and deploying a website on Apache server inside ec2 instances in different az's using terraform.By end of this project we will have an infrastructure which is hosting my website.This project is for provisioning the infrastucture but we can use user_data to deploy something on instances.
